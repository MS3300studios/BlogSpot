This code is my portfolio project. If anyone wants to use it to learn from it, or modify it, they need to credit me as the creator.
I do not allow this project to be used in any commercial use. The code in this project should only be reviewed by interested people, 
and if anyone wants to modify it or use parts of it for their own project, they can, but they need to credit me in a visible place.
